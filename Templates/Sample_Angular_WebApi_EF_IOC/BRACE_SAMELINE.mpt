/*
	Use this to create open braces in C# code, managing formatting and indenting according to your desired style.
	
	This works best of you have USETABS set to true to handle your indenting.
	You can set your desired tab (spaces or tabs) with the TABSTRING property (usually in your Solution template).
	
	If the value is true, the brace will be emitted at the end of the line (K&R style), as in:
	
	if (xxx) {
	}
	
	If the value is false, the brace will be emitted in a new line (Allman style), as in:
	
	if (xxx)
	{
	}
